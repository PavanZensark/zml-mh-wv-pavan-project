## Firestore Database Schema Design

### 1. Collections Overview

The database consists of 7 main collections designed for optimal security, performance, and scalability:

```
zmlpavan (Firebase Project)
├── users/
├── health_info/
├── comprehensive_health_info/
├── appointments/
├── medications/

- **Balance**: Optimize for read performance while maintaining data integrity

#### **Security-First Design**
- User-based data isolation through `userId` fields
- Role-based access through `assignedPhysicianId` relationships
- Document-level security rules for fine-grained access control

#### **Scalability Considerations**
- Document size limits respected (< 1MB per document)
- Efficient indexing strategy for common query patterns
- Subcollection structure avoided for simplicity
